# intersectionArray
Daily Challenge: write a function that creates an intersection of two arrays. 

# Function requirements
The function should take two arrays as arguments and return the intersection of them.

Many may be familiar with the intersection of two tables in a database, but intersection actually comes to us from set theory in mathematics.
<br><br>
The intersection of two sets (A,B) is the set containing all elements of A that also belong to B (or equivalently, all elements of B that also belong to A). All elements of the intersection set must be unique. Therfore, if there are two of the same values in both of the original sets, the intersection set will only have that value once.
